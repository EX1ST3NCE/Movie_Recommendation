# Content Based Movie Recommendation System

Research Paper : http://www.riejournal.com/article_121501.html

Recommendation system aims to predict or take users’ interests and recommend related items that quite likely are interesting for them. The growth in the amount of information that is available online and the increase in the number of Internet users has created an overload of information which makes it difficult to find the correct information at the right time. The Recommender systems solves this problem  by filtering the required data from large amount of information that are generated on the basis of  user’s interest or preferences.

Content-based filtering techniques normally generate their predictions based on the user information, and does not rely on the contributions or ratings from other users as done in collaborative techniques.

Our system provides a web application to the user in which user can give their inputs and generate outcomes based on their interest. It also displays the top rated movies and also the most popular movies among them.
